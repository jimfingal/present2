Present! zine # 2, as you can see, is on a cd. We couldn't decide whether or not we wanted to have a table of contents, or have people find all of the pieces by exploring some sort of video-gamesque radioheadwebsiteinspired-, image-mapped etc. etc. interface, so we decided to do both, and then some: you can access all of the pieces through this table of contents, or you can jump into the world of the magazine thorough one of the gateways. Every page is also equipped with a handy navigation system &ntilde; click on the !? to get to the map. The goal is for you to explore. 

A SUGGESTED PATH through the ZINE:

This is an example of a path that takes you through all of the gateways. There are many of these, and lots of loops, and so on:

.***/- Start in the .infinite castle of art. Find the exit to the .comics labyrinth. find your way to the middle circle of the labyrinth, find the crackduck comic, and pull the lever beneath it to be transported to .cubeville. Take a jaunt to the scary cave mouth and back by pressing 1, then when you're done follow the road back to cubeville. Follow X to the girl with the coffee. Click on the left eye, then the left arrows to go to the .folded box forest. Find your way to folded4 and click on the box that is in the middle, one from the bottom to get to the Present! playset. Click on the bottle to take you to the .Besti(scaaaa)ary. After looking at all the beasts, say you are a controlling beast to ge to the .remote control. Click on the arrow down to get to the .Gate Gateway. Click on the tower on your left to get to the .Present Vidset. The TV will then take you to the .Digital Age.

Make up your own path!!!!
