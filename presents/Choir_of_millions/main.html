        <p>I went to the World Cup in Korea in 2002 and got a taste of what real 
          patriotism is like.&nbsp; I'm talking about millions—literally, millions—of 
          people, all in red shirts, all drunk off their rear-ends, and all singing 
          songs about how their country is the best country in the world.&nbsp; 
          I'm talking about fireworks being shot off in every direction, vomit 
          being spewed forth onto every street corner, and boys and girls, men 
          and women, old and young, holding hands, dancing and jumping in the 
          streets.&nbsp; I'm talking about confetti.&nbsp; And everyone—everyone—had 
          black hair, white skin, Korean eyes, and Korean bodies.&nbsp; They were 
          all Korean.&nbsp; Except for me.&nbsp; And my three friends. </p>
        <p>Even though this was soccer, we were never afraid for our lives.&nbsp; 
          There was no hint of violence in the air.&nbsp; There was only joy, 
          exuberance, and pride, and, although we were foreigners, the Koreans 
          showed us immaculate hospitality, genuine fascination, or, at worst, 
          feigned indifference.&nbsp; I would rate the experience up there with 
          some of the most transcendent experiences of my life. </p>
        <p>That's why I was so disappointed to see, a few months later, back in 
          the Ol' U-S-of-A, on the front page of the L.A. Times, as I happened 
          to be walking down Sunset Boulevard, passing a newspaper dispenser, 
          a full-color picture of a similar scene: &nbsp;God-knows how many Koreans, 
          in red shirts all, storming the streets of Seoul, not in celebration, 
          but in protest, <em>vehement </em> protest, and not against someone 
          or something else, but against <em>me </em>, I mean, against <em>America 
          </em>, and, I imagine, all that it stands for.&nbsp; I stared at the 
          newspaper, through the little plastic window, and thought to myself, 
          “What happened?&nbsp; What did I do?” </p>
        <p>There are a lot of people out there, apparently, who don't like America 
          .&nbsp; They want to <em>kill </em> Americans.&nbsp; This makes me sad.&nbsp; 
        </p>
        <p>I tried to blow off the issue, but kept thinking, “Millions of people 
          want to kill me and I don't know why.”&nbsp; I decided to conduct a 
          serious inquiry into myself, my life, my actions, my motives, and my 
          habits, and find out why, exactly, I am hated. </p>
        <p>The first thing I had to admit to myself, with shame, as I examined, 
          is that I do not floss regularly.&nbsp; I know this doesn't warrant 
          killing me, in and of itself, but I think it points to a deeper flaw 
          in my character: &nbsp;I'm stubbornly reluctant to expend energy on 
          any activity that doesn't bring me immediate material or social rewards.&nbsp; 
          Indeed, that sounds very American and perhaps that is one reason I am 
          hated. </p>
        <p>Second of all, I have listened to a lot of Heavy Metal in my life, 
          decadent music by some culture's standards.&nbsp; I had the Ozzy Ozbourne 
          album where he had the jelly-like substance dripping from his mouth 
          and I thrilled at the thought of him biting a head off a dead bat.&nbsp; 
          I played electric guitar, loudly, through my teens, regardless of others' 
          ears and peace of mind, and grew up to be a rock star and continue the 
          legacy of decadence that is rock music.&nbsp; I admit this. </p>
        <p>I also watched a fair amount of TV growing up.&nbsp; In eighth grade, 
          I would come home every day from school and watch <em>Guiding Light 
          </em>.&nbsp; One of the only times I've ever been star-struck—like totally 
          pulling-on-the-sleeve-of-the-friend-next-to-me-saying-“look who's here!”-star-struck—was 
          after my band played on Saturday Night Live in 2001, and at the after 
          party, in the plaza in front of Rockefeller Center, the actor who played 
          Phillip Spaulding—lover of the mysterious Nola Ryan—walked by.&nbsp; 
          Some cultures might find this shallowness hateful in me, and I can understand 
          why. </p>
        <p>I practically flunked out of high-school, completely taking the opportunity, 
          and my own talents, for granted.&nbsp; I even cheated on my English 
          final exam, senior year.&nbsp; I got caught, though, so I don't feel 
          as bad as if I had gotten away with it.&nbsp; Ultimately, I didn't give 
          a darn about classes.&nbsp; I just wanted to play floor hockey and look 
          at girls.&nbsp; Now that I'm an adult, &nbsp;I <em>still </em> pretty 
          much just want to play floor hockey and look at girls.&nbsp; What culture 
          would look up to such a base creature? </p>
        <p>I don't really have any faith in any sort of a God.&nbsp; I'm “agnostic”, 
          which means, “I have <em>no idea </em> what's going on.”&nbsp; I'm pretty 
          comfortable with that term.&nbsp; It also means, however, that I don't 
          practice religion.&nbsp; I don't go to Church.&nbsp; I've never read 
          the Bible or the Torah.&nbsp; I don't think I even heard the word “Islam” 
          until I was in my twenties.&nbsp; That would make me hateful in the 
          eyes of many. </p>
        <p>I don't take much responsibility—actually, <em>any </em> responsibility—for 
          my government, or what they do.&nbsp; I often don't know who our vice 
          president is.&nbsp; I've never voted.&nbsp; I know that this sort of 
          apathy, though it may once have been fashionable in America , is now 
          just loathsome. </p>
        <p>I don't read the newspaper (except as I'm walking by dispensers on 
          the street), I don't watch the news, I don't know who's on the ten dollar 
          bill (or the five or the twenty unless I think really hard.)&nbsp; I 
          basically have no idea what's going on outside of the one square mile 
          area in which I live.&nbsp; I have made millions of dollars and yet 
          almost all of it sits in banks, who-knows-where, while millions of people 
          starve to death every year.&nbsp; (Is it really millions that starve?&nbsp; 
          I have no idea, because, apparently, I do not care enough to check.&nbsp; 
          Shameful!)&nbsp; I have had girlfriends, who loved me with all of their 
          hearts, who thought the world of me, who did anything I asked, who bought 
          me groceries, gave me rides, gave me a place to live, gave me faith 
          in myself and my manhood—who I used for all they were worth.&nbsp; I 
          ran away, once, when my brother was being beaten up, and I pretended 
          like I didn't know it was happening.&nbsp; Worst of all, when I try 
          to make sense of myself, the world, and my desire to be a better person, 
          I get overwhelmed and give up.&nbsp; I crawl back into my little shell 
          and just hope that things will be okay.&nbsp; That's pretty bad. </p>
        <p>Therefore, I can understand why the world hates me.&nbsp; I really 
          can.&nbsp; But that doesn't make it any easier to accept the fact that 
          I'll never be able to join the crowd in Korea , to join them in singing, 
          dancing, shooting off fireworks, and knowing that my voice is but one 
          in a choir of millions. </p>
