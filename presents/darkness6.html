<h1 align="left">Call and Response</h1>
<p>I am on the bus to Boston, almost alone.<br>
  Some girls my age are chatting two seats up;<br>
  the few others are quiet. Vermont </p>
<p>planes into hills here, the moon is full <br>
  and the still-bare trees are black, pitch, <br>
  and flat, they are thin as daggers tonight. </p>
<p>My reflection is one bright page,<br>
  lit arms and lap, shadows where I wish<br>
  I could see eyes. I am thinking six things:</p>
<p>1. Jay-Z rhymes in my headphones: the pressure of sweat, <br>
  where we dance. His women are fine, are not there, <br>
  are his, he sings of sex then leaving, <br>
  but what rhythm like lightnings, <br>
  like it feels like being carried, <br>
  it feels like we are dancing even with those we can’t see.</p>
<p>2. I’ve been reading Hopkins, underneath the music. <br>
  New rhythm, I feel myself called into this night, this ink, <br>
  I imagine the bus full, <br>
  the way it was driving up. Is this different <br>
  than imagining the dark riders here, real across aisle’s distance, <br>
  empty seats? The Asian man to my left waited with me<br>
  at the station; we stood alone by the driverless bus. <br>
  He kept pointing, asking me, “bus ticket?” <br>
  He showed me his creased pass.<br>
  I brought out my own, and he pointed at it, “bus ticket?”<br>
  Yes, yes this is a ticket, yes this is the bus,<br>
  and he asked me, “bus ticket?” What on earth could he mean?</p>
<p>3. Last night I couldn’t sleep, I felt it twice: <br>
  God or something awful moving through me, rigid, jaw snapping, <br>
  I remember forcing it shut. <br>
  I remember the weight of breath, buzzing skin, remember thinking <br>
  I was strong, stronger than what<br>
  moved through me, was not right, was too much: <br>
  so I gave up, I let it through me, <br>
  and it worked. It left. Then later it happened again.</p>
<p>4. Liquor by the fire that moonrise, waking all the night:<br>
  Long past, but also Vermont: <br>
  we stepped outside at dawn, butter yellow, <br>
  purple, dark leaves of birch. We were naked. <br>
  Would have smelled like sex if warm. <br>
  But instead it was mist, twigs hurt our feet in the moss. <br>
  How sweet, that honey climb of light! <br>
  How I wish I could feel how she felt, <br>
  or that I had something to say to say to her. <br>
  How I pray to have something to say.</p>
<p>5. The fear last night is over. I am sitting up in bed. <br>
  In the mirror is a circle of mattress, body, <br>
  beside me the sheets bunched like another asleep. <br>
  In this scene my head is a stained glass flower and bee; <br>
  curled small, dull, milky, a body half swallowed by bloom.<br>
  My great uncle made this in the last years of his life.<br>
  He was at D-Day, he waded from those boats. <br>
  Dark breakers, I can’t ask him what happened: <br>
  I wouldn’t have fought in that war. What distance—<br>
  Pearl Harbor, French beach; <br>
  the bombers over Auschwitz, their targets miles away—<br>
  right triangles—God—I’m not saying there aren’t heroes,<br>
  he was trying to help end it, to go home. <br>
  And here I am, my religion giving up: <br>
  all the good Quakers are dying, who inspired, <br>
  who rebuilt bombed out Europe, I know one <br>
  who laid his arm out for a military needle: <br>
  they made him sick, tried to cure him. <br>
  He volunteered; everyone wanted to heal.</p>
<p>6. There is room in the mind for one more. <br>
  What missing. Seventh, I am sick. Come back. <br>
  Bridges, lanterns, birches, extinguished city lights.<br>
  You are passing, moon, missing. God rekindle. <br>
  I am calling into this night, it is quiet. Another <br>
  asleep in a poem.<br>
