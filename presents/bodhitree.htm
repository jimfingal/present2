<div align="center"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="body" --> 
<center>  
    <div align="left" class="bodhi"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      To whom it may concern: </div>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> The one freedom that you have that no one can 
    take away is response.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> By reading this, you have become responsible; 
    but that does not dictate, in any way, the gravity or colour of your response.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> Let me tell you that I hope to be pleasantly 
    surprised. You may describe the situation before you as a mess; if you are 
    of a more analytical bent, you may codify it as a prank, with all of the motivations 
    leading up to such. Perhaps you think of it as random; a monument to nothing; 
    limbo that has been wreathed, clandestine, in metaphor and simile. The point 
    of fact is that what you choose to think is up to you; again, let me note 
    that, though, as I said before, I hope to be pleasantly surprised, I altogether 
    doubt that will be the case. Such is the nature of surprise. Events as I predict 
    them will unfold in such a manner: upon first sight of this missive and the 
    design which it is attached to, your curiosity will be aroused. You will, 
    regardless of your place in life, stoop to investigate yourself, to be the 
    first to break the seal, so to speak. If you are bitter, curmudgeonly, or 
    simply possessed of a self-standing sense of humor, chances are you will be 
    mildly amused. If you hold your moral fibre close to your chest, you may be 
    slightly offended at the seeming pointlessness of my expression; if this is 
    the case, I would recommend you cease reading; my moral fibre insists that 
    I inflame you further.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> From here, happenstance becomes disgustingly 
    predictable.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> If you lack self-confidence and are in a position 
    in your life where such a deep-seated trait is acceptable, both to you and 
    especially to those around you, then you will probably deal with the event 
    I have set in motion yourself; not on your own time, of course, and not without 
    instruction from a superior, but you will deal with it. If you dwell on the 
    opposite end of the spectrum, and are both comfortable with yourself and in 
    charge of the path of your life, the odds dictate that you will call on another 
    to deal with this event for you.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> You can crumple this up and throw it away. You 
    can call on janitors, policemen, official-looking passers-by, or anyone else 
    obliged to serve, and allot time for them to deconstruct and dispose of that 
    which I have created. If you fit into one of the aforementioned groups, you 
    may even be doing the disposing yourself.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> The beauty of your freedom as a human being, 
    regardless of your sex, creed, race, social or economic standing, orientation, 
    goals, and/or path in life, is that you do not have to. There is something 
    majestic inherent in being able to choose your own response regardless of 
    what cards life hands you. If you do decide to unmake what I have created, 
    I sincerely hope that you do it with conviction. I will not be surprised if 
    you do decide to ignore this wholeheartedly, even to the point of putting 
    effort into forcing it out of your mind. You can, and probably will, forget 
    that this ever happened.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> Or, what I have placed before you can become 
    your Bhodi tree. You can accept it, and keep this correspondence to yourself, 
    hopefully gleaning some productive meaning from it, and go about your day, 
    week, month, year, life. You can permit or allow others to deal with the menial 
    task of reading the novel, only to have them recite to you the most profound 
    symbols and pressing contrasts.</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodhi"> Perhaps you will surprise me. Again, such is 
    the nature of surprise, and surprise and response often go hand in hand. Perhaps 
    you will wallpaper your office with Prester John's address, so to speak; perhaps 
    you will leave this garbage be, if it is indeed that, for, when something 
    one regards as trash is not cleaned up, it is visible to others, and, if one 
    person can learn from a mess rather than be sheltered from it, why not a thousand? 
    If a man steps on a piece of broken glass and then decides to invent the shoe, 
    has he not both learned and grown, by embracing adversity, then transcending 
    it? You can take what I have proposed a step further, if such is your calling. 
    You can discuss it with others, show this scene to your teachers and students 
    alike, pass this message on to friends, family members, and co- workers, by 
    word of mouth or by simple suggestion. It is within both your right and your 
    power to do so; still, there is a chance you may not.</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodhi"> You may decide to squelch this message in a 
      bottle immediately. I still hold that you probably will. If this is the 
      case, I hope that what I have done leads to the pondering of potential outcomes. 
      I should pray that you think about what might have happened, had you chosen 
      a different route. Response is a cycle of infinities; what you do or do 
      not do will, in turn, create a non-stop chain of events that may sway pendulously 
      based on one decision, made once, in a split-second. I beseech you to think, 
      if no one else will.<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,<br>
      <br>
      ...</p>
