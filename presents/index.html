Issue # 2.,.,.,., ::-- Table       of IntroDUCKtion Contents.</strong></span><br>  </p>    <p><strong>The Theme of this issue is: BEAT!</strong><br>      [[[of course, this is only loosely defined and was meant to inspire rather       than to limit so we have lots of stuff that is non- or semi- beat/beet related       too.]]] </p>    <p><strong>Inside:</strong> BEATS, beets, also beasts, Music, Images, Poems,       Proses, Poetry, Prosetry, Videos, Dances, REVOLUTION, kindness, LOTS of       (purposefull | accidental | porpoisefull) atypography a type o'graphie tipeohgraffy,       bread and cheese and trees, giant ROBOTS and strange beasts, and Comic books,       and also music+videos, and interviews with famouse peoples who also may       or may not have given us music, beets, Beats, Beatification, in the form       of a three dimensional infinite castle, a maze or labrinth or labrynth or       so, some folded boxes, SEAMUS HEANEY, music by PHIL ELVRUM as well as an       interview and and interview about CALVIN JOHNSON where he talks about beats       and so does MF DOOM. We have the reports of events we have done throughout       the year as well as evidence of them, and sometimes also the byproducts       of them when [non-]art or something like it spontaneously generated from       them.</p>    <p><strong>Present! Magazine number 2,</strong> as you can see, is on a cd.       We couldn't decide whether or not we wanted to have a table of contents,       or have people find all of the pieces by exploring some sort of strange       video-gamesque radioheadwebsiteinspired-, image-mapped etc. etc. interface,       so we decided to do both: you can access all of the pieces through this       table of contents, or you can jump into the world of the magazine thorough       one of the gateways and explore through there, but preferably you'll do       both, because the goal is for you to have fun. And because some things can       only be seen through the table of contents, and others only though exploring       things. </p>    <p class="toc_smalltext">((( notice: <strong>PRESENT!</strong> is a gift,       a cube, a happening, sharing, for nerds, a DIY obliterary magazine, a manifesto       party, alove, a cd, for you, an array of happy tire swings in the yard,       letter-writing to the future, color field trips, thanking you now, a silent       dance party, beat, made at the bow and arrow press, being, everyone, a lot       of meeties, an object, making noises!, not art, a poem about a robot, a       24-hour comics festival, hiding something (or someone) somewhere, broke,       not another one, it's an other one, content with just this, right here,       now, here )))</p>    <p>....//(a letter from one of the designers).txt<br>    </p>    <p class="toc_medtitle"><strong>Gateways:</strong></p>  These are different ways to get around the magazine. They are not pieces themselves,     well, sometimes they are pieces, but for the most part they link to other     pieces. Hint: Click on everything because there are a lot of hidden links!     Very few pages link to nothing (but some do, as in have no links, and also     as in have dead links to play tricks with you). If it is no longer fun for     you to move around in the magazine through a gateway, then it is not cheating     to go back to the table of contents and go-start somewhere else.     <p><a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="malmain.html">Girl Sitting with a Painted       Face, a Gateway.</a><br>      <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="jimtown.html">The Scary Cave Mouth, a       Gateway.</a><br>      <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="digital_age.html">Digital Age, a Gateway.</a><br>      <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="cubeville.html">Cubeville, a Gateway and       Crossroads </a> <br>      <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="presentlabyrinth/labyrinthintro2.html">The       Comics Labyrinth</a><br>      <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="castle.html">The INFINITE Castle of art</a><br>      The Folded Box Forest: Entrance <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="folded.html">1</a>,       <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="folded3.html">2</a>, <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="folded4.html">3</a><br>      <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="gategateway.html">The Gate Gateway</a><br>      <a target="_blank" class="toclink" href="vidset/index.html">The Present!

Follow X to the girl with the coffee.       Click on the left eye, then the left arrows to go to the .folded box forest.       Find your way to folded4 and click on the box that is in the middle, one       from the bottom to get to the Present! playset. Click on the bottle to take       you to the .Besti(scaaaa)ary. After looking at all the beasts, say you are       a controlling beast to get to the .remote control. Click on the arrow down       to get to the .Gate Gateway. Click on the tower on your left to get to the       .Present Vidset.
