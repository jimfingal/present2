    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
      <p align="left" class="tokyo">&#8220;That&#8217;s time.&#8221; </p>
  
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">One of the weird things about spring break was 
      getting back to Cambridge and realizing I had $0.03 in my bank account. 
      Particularly remarkable because the last time I&#8217;d removed cash was 
      at 3am in Rappongi, one of Tokyo&#8217;s club districts, and I&#8217;d apparently 
      requested the very number of yen that would exactly annihilate my hard-earned 
      dollars.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">I&#8217;m not a really hard partier in America. 
      But there&#8217;s something inexcusable about sleeping in a city you may 
      never see again. And certainly when you&#8217;ll never be 22 again. So this 
      March my friends and I spent a lot of nights and early mornings wandering 
      the safe, quiet streets of Tokyo, looking for fun. The subway shuts down 
      around midnight and begins running at 5am, so that means either walking 
      home (taxis are expensive) or staying out (Tokyo&#8217;s enormous). </p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Which isn&#8217;t to say that the daytime isn&#8217;t 
      great, too. With an understanding that we could never learn everything and 
      would probably gouge each other&#8217;s eyes out if we tried, my travel-gang 
      (Taz, Jane, Ben) adopted a somewhat haphazard approach to tourism. Getting 
      lost was okay. Returning to places we liked was fine. It was important to 
      have time to sit in caf&eacute;s and read, and to fantasize about living 
      in Tokyo for real. We weren&#8217;t going to pretend we knew about Japan 
      by going to kabuki shows or sumo matches; instead, we&#8217;d make our way 
      through the city as we pleased. That said, even very &#8220;Japanese things&#8221; 
      can surprise you. There are small, wooden temples on streets full of urban 
      development. The cherry blossoms were beginning to explode in parks and 
      gardens. While sashimi is expensive, other sushi can be bought in lunch 
      boxes to go or from conveyor belts in restaurants for well under $10 a meal 
      (often more like $5). Eating sushi while people-watching in a sunny park 
      is something I do in America: but it tastes better in Tokyo.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Here are some fun things we did and some facts 
      and impressions of Tokyo.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">People are generally really polite &#8211; almost 
      uncomfortably polite, from an American perspective. Store clerks bow their 
      heads and smile, and I found myself doing the same. More than that, though, 
      people inconvenienced themselves in order to make us comfortable. I asked 
      a woman on the street where the bathhouse was and she walked me several 
      blocks to get there. Taz asked a clerk in a store where the park was and 
      the clerk found his manager, who found her manager, who offered to show 
      her the way. Jane asked a bartender where the nearest cigarette machine 
      was and he went down the street to buy her a pack; when he saw her fumbling 
      with matches he lit her cigarette for her. I don&#8217;t know to what extent 
      this is just how people behave or if it&#8217;s a generosity reserved for 
      befuddled tourists. Sometimes the politeness manifests itself in a decorum 
      that made me feel like I had my fly perpetually unzipped; you can receive 
      dirty looks for laughing too loudly or blowing your nose in public. Tokyo 
      seemed really fastidious but simultaneously offered up perpetual, often 
      offbeat entertainment &#8211; I loved this split personality. </p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">You might be interested to know that cigarettes 
      cost about $2.50-$3 a pack. And they are sold in vending machines. The variety 
      of drinks sold in vending machines is astonishing: coffee is particularly 
      popular, and comes both hot and cold. One of the guide books in our hostel 
      said there were 70 people for every vending machine in the city.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">A lot of people in Tokyo wear what look like 
      surgical masks, because they are worried about catching the avian flu. One 
      time in a caf&eacute; I saw a guy enter wearing a facemask, which he promptly 
      removed to smoke a cigarette. I was really curious about couples on the 
      streets, when one was wearing a mask while the other wasn&#8217;t. How did 
      they meet? What was flirting like? Or kissing? Did they argue about the 
      efficacy of facemasks?</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Arcades have a vast array of games, most of 
      which I couldn&#8217;t care less about because they involve cars or wizards. 
      But there is one game &#8211; simply dubbed &#8220;The Drum Game&#8221; 
      by my blockmate Ben &#8211; which is spectacular and, while easily described, 
      also ineffably magical. There are two enormous drums (resembling the ceremonial 
      drums we&#8217;d seen at Buddhist shrines) that 2 players compete to hit 
      in coordination with the series of lights scrolling across the screen. Hitting 
      correctly results in bangs, flashes, and streams of color. It is the happiest 
      game I have ever played. Even losers are celebrated by the dancing animals 
      on the screen, and the players&#8217; icons &#8211; personified drums &#8211; 
      jump and giggle in piles of flowers.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">There is an Irish pub in Ueno called The Warrior 
      Celt that is open until 5am. There are Irish pubs in every city in the world, 
      but this one is fabulous because a) it&#8217;s 4am and Japanese people are 
      singing Irish folk songs and b) there&#8217;s something irresistible about 
      lonely expatriates dancing badly to The Clash and The Pogues. Someone apologized 
      to Jane for Japanese persecution of her Korean ancestors. The night we went 
      to the Warrior Celt I discovered a painful blister on my hand at dinner 
      (from overexertion at The Drum Game), which disappeared by the time we took 
      the subway home at 6am.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">There is a trance club in Aoyama called Manic 
      Love that opens on Sunday morning at 6 and closes at 11. A cover charge 
      of $10 buys you a free cup of coffee. Priceless things about Manic Love 
      include Jane being bled on by a beautiful, tripped-out raver. And the ambiguously 
      European guy wearing ass-less chaps under his pimp jacket who told us we 
      were too high-strung. &#8220;How does he know that?&#8221; I wondered.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Slightly ominous names of bars: Gas Panic, 911, 
      Propaganda.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Food I saw that was sold on a stick: chicken 
      strips, chicken lumps, tofu, whole fish with scales et al., squid lumps, 
      corn dogs, chocolate-covered bananas.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">The Tokyo fish market opens around 4:30. This 
      is one of those things every tourist does but is still worthwhile. All of 
      the fishermen bring their catch to the market to be sold to restaurant chefs. 
      It&#8217;s so enormous and expansive that new species are sometimes discovered 
      there. (Sometimes apparently Steven Tyler can be discovered there, but we 
      didn&#8217;t see him.) We wandered the stalls, entranced by the brightly-colored 
      piles of fish and shellfish, and lingered too long watching a young woman 
      chop the heads off squirming, struggling fish the length of her arm. There 
      are shops near the market that sell just-caught, just-killed sashimi; it 
      is expensive but delicious.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Gwen Stefani is teaching America about Harajuku 
      but that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t still awesome. That&#8217;s the 
      neighborhood where schoolgirls go to wear Victorian-influenced maid costumes, 
      white makeup, hundreds of barettes and multi-colored socks. It is a good 
      neighborhood for thrift store shopping and also for buying T-shirts with 
      mangled English phrases or philosophical musings. Ben bought a black shirt 
      with white chess pieces falling poetically across the background and the 
      following text: <br>
      &#8220;Lucky Adventurer<br>
      There is a big difference between leisure time and time spent in haste.<br>
      Time can be a strong ally or a crushing enemy. That's time.<br>
      The more free time I have, the more I tend to think of bad things.<br>
      I want no more time competition. From now I need more leisurely time.<br>
      How many well-spent hours do you have in a day?&#8221;</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Karaoke is fun. It seems mostly to be run by 
      conglomerates that have bought huge buildings (some up to 20 floors high) 
      and filled them with private rooms where businessmen or tourists can sing 
      like idiots while waitresses ply them with alcohol and creamy desserts.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">People read pornographic manga unashamedly on 
      the subway. Businessmen buy vintage &#8220;art&#8221; magazines from vendors 
      at lunch-time. A hostess club &#8211; no sex, just talking &#8211; can cost 
      $400/hour.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">I was often the tallest person on the subway 
      and hit my head on several doorframes. </p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Richard Gere is currently part of several ad 
      campaigns in Tokyo.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">Cool girls in Tokyo are currently wearing long 
      denim shorts instead of skirts. This is the sort of garment that can look 
      good if you are short, skinny and confident. Truly admirable: looking sexy 
      while wearing long denim shorts, knee socks and a red flannel men&#8217;s 
      shirt.</p>
    <p align="left" class="tokyo">There&#8217;s a good deal more. Tokyo 
      is expensive if you want to buy electronics, sashimi, high fashion or time 
      with an English-speaking hostess. It&#8217;s affordable if you spend wisely. 
      Stay in our hostel, the Guess T House. The owners provide free rice, pasta, 
      spices, laundry soap, internet access and a karaoke machine for the tv. 
      It&#8217;s clean, affordable and social, located in the upscale neighborhood 
      of Azabu-Juban. There&#8217;s a bathhouse down the street where you can 
      scald yourself pink, a fine stationery shop, a park full of little kids 
      and old men, and a bakery selling delicious red bean-filled pastries and 
      buttery Ginza cakes.<br><br><br>--Sarah Burke
