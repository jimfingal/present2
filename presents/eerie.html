      To: apastern@fas.harvard.edu<br>
      Subject: RE: the questions...</strong> </div>
    <p align="left">&gt;Where are you now?</p>
    <p align="left">I am in my parents' house in Anacortes, Wash.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Our issue's theme is Beat, beet, beat. You seem obsessed with it. What 
      are<br>
      &gt;your thoughts?<br>
      &gt;<br>
      I am obsessed with what?</p>
    <p align="left">&gt;(And what is the significance of the percussion in a song? 
      In a<br>
      &gt;microphones song? Are there particular songs that you are proud of from 
      a<br>
      &gt;percussive point of view?)</p>
    <p align="left">I think I hear everything in terms of percussion. It is everything 
      to me.<br>
      I think the song of King Dark Death on the Mt. Eerie album has some cool<br>
      drums. I didn't use a computer or anything for that, (or anything ever,<br>
      besides this email) and I am a little proud of making &quot;electronica&quot; 
      type of<br>
      beats with my hands.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Do you have a favorite instrument?</p>
    <p align="left">I suppose my hands.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;When did you start to sing, and how did you find your voice?</p>
    <p align="left">I think we sung in Montessori school. I can't remember. There 
      were a few<br>
      dinosaur songs.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Who are your major influences and/or heroes?</p>
    <p align="left">I don't want to start listing people.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Did you ever study music?</p>
    <p align="left">I took one piano lesson and I played tuba in the school band 
      for 3 years. I<br>
      don't count any of that though. I didn't know what was going on. I was<br>
      just pushing the right keys.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;How big a part of your life is the making of visual art?</p>
    <p align="left">These days it is small because I have been travelling too 
      much, but soon it<br>
      will be huge. I need to make big paintings.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;The music scene in Washington has been your soil, I take it: how important<br>
      &gt;is the community to art making for you?</p>
    <p align="left">Sometimes it's very important, though it's not always in a 
      direct way. I<br>
      usually prefer to be creative in a solitary way but I always need the<br>
      foundation of friends and family to be able to do that. It is good to have<br>
      a bunch of friends in the same building all working on their own thing and<br>
      not speaking.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;How/where do you find new music?</p>
    <p align="left">I have a very hard time getting into new things, and the world 
      is cramming<br>
      it down my throat. I have taken up a defensive position and now I try not<br>
      to listen to anything.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Is there someone you really want to make music with?</p>
    <p align="left">I have many friends who I wish I could make more music with. 
      They are<br>
      people who also want to make music with me but it doesn't happen because<br>
      everybody is always thrown all over the globe, busy trying to feed their<br>
      children. Karl Blau, Eddy Blau, Genevieve Elverum, Mirah Zeitlyn, Julie<br>
      Doiron, Jason Anderson, Mike Feuerstack, Adam Forkner, Nikaidoh Kazumi, 
      etc.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;How do you record these days? Do you use computers at all?</p>
    <p align="left">No. I don't record at all. I am trying to start again. I have 
      been<br>
      collecting enough equpment to do it. I have an 8 track.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;When I listen, I can sense a space, and a type of weather, and sometimes<br>
      &gt;think of stories just from listening to the music; it can be very<br>
      &gt;inspirational when making my own stuff, whatever it is. What inspires 
      you,<br>
      &gt;and what conditions do you like to have, when you write?</p>
    <p align="left">Songs come out when I don't expect it. There is no one circumstance. 
      They<br>
      come at weird times.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Do you write with an audience in mind, or is it much more personal?</p>
    <p align="left">Sometimes I write directly TO an audience but I am trying 
      not to because<br>
      that just sounds preachy.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Many of your sounds are irreproducible, even for you I imagine, except<br>
      &gt;through recording. (This seemed a disappointment to some people in the<br>
      &gt;audience in Cambridge who have attached their heads to The Glow for 
      many<br>
      &gt;hours on end.) How much comfort do you take in the recorded medium vs. 
      the<br>
      &gt;live one, and is it ever a problem for you?</p>
    <p align="left">I always just think of it as 2 seperate things. The live show 
      has<br>
      completely new and different &quot;songs&quot;. It would be shitty if I 
      got a big<br>
      band together with 8 musicians and toured in a big white van with a uhaul<br>
      trailer and had the keyboard dude who cued up the sample of the wind and 
      I<br>
      had the 3 guitar players with all their pedals and the tight drummer playing<br>
      the exact beats from the CD, even learning the flaws. People do that. I<br>
      hate that kind of thing. The CD is made so people can listen to that kind<br>
      of thing in their home. When they come to the show I want people to see 
      a<br>
      real live person doing something in front of them. I let myself make<br>
      mistakes and make up new songs at shows. Maybe some people would be<br>
      disappointed to not hear their favorite songs but I still think it's better<br>
      than being too scared to put myself out on a limb.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Alicia Keys is now writing a travel column for the Boston Globe from 
      her<br>
      &gt;tour, which will include a show on the Great Wall I'm told. You are 
      a<br>
      &gt;something of a tireless traveler, and to often exotic places and unlikely<br>
      &gt;stages, so how do you digest all of it, process it? Ie, will you have 
      a<br>
      &gt;travel column?\</p>
    <p align="left">I used to keep detailed journals but after the 3rd time of 
      visiting the same<br>
      places and not being able to tell St. Paul from Pittsburgh from Atlanta 
      from<br>
      Kansas City from Denver I stopped. Not that I think all places are the<br>
      same. I just started paying attention to more subtle charms. (eating,<br>
      bathing, sleeping) Also, I stopped taking pictures. I think it is a<br>
      better way to live.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Do you have an i-pod? And what is his/her name?</p>
    <p align="left">I don't. I won't.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;What do you think about mp3s? Is that the future then?</p>
    <p align="left">I don't know anything about it. My head is in the sand.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;What has been the most surprising part of all of this for you?</p>
    <p align="left">People with Microphones tattoos.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Who's Woelvy? She is amazing. Are you married?</p>
    <p align="left">Its' &quot;Woelv&quot;. She is named Genevieve. We are married.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;Is there a particular direction you're headed in these days, as far 
      as<br>
      &gt;music goes? Or as far as life goes? (I heard you were recently<br>
      &gt;married...is this true?)</p>
    <p align="left">I am going to try to make some records. I don't know what 
      will be on them<br>
      yet. I am starting right now. I will look for a home now too.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;<br>
      Thanks,<br>
      seeyou<br>
      Phil</p>
