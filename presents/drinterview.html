        artist Dario Robleto's work is a veritable mixtape of humanity, and sometimes 
        he even makes mixtapes (and a plethora of other objects) using human bones. 
        It is in the recycling and recombination of material that Robleto finds 
        real newness and hope for a civilization still dealing with the devestation 
        (and the amazing innovations) of the 20th century as it enters the ever 
        uncertain territory of the 21st. When he remixes materials and histories--much 
        like the hip-hop DJ from whom he takes both literal and philosophical 
        cues--his work finds in the old and forgotten a wellspring for new associations, 
        reflecting back our own concepts of these old things and giving us new 
        possibilities for imagining the future.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Robleto's recent exhibitions include

      <p align="left" class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:150%;color:white'>A: 
        I believe in a magic that’s possible.  I think there’s something much 
        more encompassing for everyone if they believe in a magic that is attainable 
        rather than the form of magic that we grow up with as children.  I’m interested 
        in magic in relation to alchemy. The alchemist believed they were going 
        to succeed in what they were doing and that’s the key to what I’m doing 
        too. My works often fall in this area between truth and fiction because 
        the materials or what I have done with them seem so unbelievable at first 
        glance. I like working in this in between region because <span class=GramE>the</span> 
        viewer has to take a stance. Either you believe me, you come with me, 
        or you don’t and either way is valid.  To raise the issue of truth in 
        artwork is such a valid thing to do right now, especially in 2004, with 
        the whole issue of faith and how it’s manipulating politics all over the 
        world. Truth gets muddied.  I’m aware of that and trying to force it out, 
        but I also acknowledge the viewer’s participation and the fact that they 
        can fill in the blanks. But bottom line, in my work I would NEVER say 
        or do something I didn’t really do. I find lying completely boring and 
        part of a postmodern, ironic, cynical, apolitical stance I adamantly oppose. 
        To really do and mean what you say is where it gets interesting. I stated 
        this once before but what does it say of a culture where to be sincere 
        has become the radical gesture? </span></p>

        think about their viewer anymore.  Even in the past decade, there has 
        been this confrontation with the viewer.  There is this new gothic sensibility.  
        To me, working like that is confrontational in a negative way.  It doesn’t 
        allow the viewer to have a door in and I always want a door in for my 
        viewer, although some people have mentioned that there is so much information 
        in my work sometimes that it becomes an impediment. The way I see it<span class=GramE>,  
        “</span>It’s there if you want it.”  If you spend the time digging through 
        these layers I promise to make it an interesting endeavor. I leave a lot 
        up to the viewer at that point. I am assuming my viewers are smart and 
        actually want to engage. This not a stance I think most art takes to its 
        viewers. The idea of universality is in my work in that I’m super- conscious 
        of the viewer’s participation and that everyone can in a sense be a walking 
        jukebox. I hope my <span class=GramE>artworks put a coin in everyone and 
        ignites</span> some personal soundtrack whether through a song reference

line-height:150%;font-family:Helvetica;color:white'>A: So far to date, amazingly, 
        there’s never been a material that I haven’t somehow been able to track 
        down.   It’s a really strange process because - swamp root, cramp bark, 
        white willow - it just has to sound right.  It has to work on the page 
        first.  The chain of reasoning will often lead me to find things I hadn’t 
        thought of before like the trinitite glass led me to other forms of really 
        strange glass.  Certain meteorites have led me to extraterrestrial lava. 
        Some asteroids are large enough that they produce some internal heat which 
        produces an active lava system.  If they’re not big enough to form a legitimate 
        atmosphere, when those volcanoes erupt, it just spews out into space, 
        there’s nothing to hold it back and it can eventually find its way onto 
        earth.  It’s lava from another world!  I couldn’t even imagine that such 
        a thing existed until I had done the research on other things.  “Extraterrestrial 
        lava”, the way those syllables work next to each other has to satisfy 
        me as much as the material itself.  That’s where it just becomes poetry.  
        I’m choosing the next material based on language, totally on language.  
        I think about what I would write next at this point and not about whether 
        I can get the material. </span></p>

        far, no one’s come up to me and been insulted by the materials, so I think 
        that’s a good sign that I’ve handled them well.  But it moves you, because 
        as I mentioned, turning to dust in poetry is one thing, but really turning 
        to dust in front of you is another thing.  It moves me because I have 
        to earn the respect of the material.  </span></p>

text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:Helvetica;color:white'>A: Music has always been a 
        constant in my life; the DJ thing specifically.  I know exactly when that 
        happened.  In 1996, I realized that I could start to investigate this 
        sculpturally.  There was so little intellectual or conceptual literature 
        being written about the burgeoning DJ culture.  It was an open field.  
        The only things that were out at the time were interviews with the DJs 
        themselves in ‘zines or specialty DJ magazines.  I would eat up anything 
        I could find because I was so eager to read about the culture in a more 
        critical way.  Now the vacuum has been filled.  There’s tons of critical 
        discourse out there.  Drum-n-bass was the thing that I was most into; 
        this really dark hardcore drum-n-bass.  I remember that every DJ would 
        talk about their work in architectural or sculptural terms.  I was so 
        curious why that was what they were using to describe their sounds.  Goldie, 
        who had no musical training would walk into the studio and say ‘I need 
        a drum beat that sounds like a rattlesnake moving through a tin coil pipe.’  
        Or others talking about a drum beat mimicking modernist architecture, 
        housing projects, repetition and the brutality of these brick buildings 
        over and over.  Across the board everyone was talking like that and it 
        started to hit me that there’s something about this musical form that 
        really has a material dimension.  There’s another DJ who I’m fascinated 
        with called Dillinja.  He would refer to himself as a bassologist.  I 
        really love this idea of the science of bass frequencies.  He was always 
        trying to make bass frequencies that would be rupturing inside your body.  
        He understood his music-making habit’s influence on the body.  Everywhere 
        I looked there was some relationship between sound and material.  I realized 
        I would never be a good DJ, but there was a lot of potential to explore 
        its material possibilities and how music and materials mutate back and 
        forth.  In 1996, I made that shift and my first vinyl works occur shortly 
        after that. </span></p>

line-height:150%;font-family:Helvetica;color:white'>A: I would definitely argue 
        that I am making music.  A musician or someone really grounded in music 
        may not think so, but that‘s what DJ culture and the avant-garde tradition, 
        with Cage and Stockhausen, opened the door to.  The techniques of a DJ 
        - spinning, splicing, scratching song selection and sequencing – are things 
        that make you a good DJ technically.  I simply transfer them over to materials.  
        That’s part of why I would argue that I’m making music.  I don’t expect 
        music to be only an audible experience, and there’s a tradition of that 
        in music.  I think I’m in that trajectory of music making.  For example, 
        in </span><i><span

line-height:150%;font-family:Helvetica;color:white'>my mother’s and father’s hips 
        are igniting some kind of music in the room.  Even with the pieces that 
        have specific references, like Patsy Cline, I like to believe that if 
        ten people are in the room, they’re all playing the song in their heads 
        and there are ten different songs playing at different moments, which 
        is how a DJ would overlap things.  But it’s all personalized.  There’s 
        an empty room in a sense, but it’s booming with music if you consider 
        the internalized soundtracks that the viewers are playing in their heads.  
        I would argue that I’m making music in that way.   </span></p>

        decision because some things are more powerful in your imagination.  For 
        example, I did a piece with an EVP recording (Electronic Voice Phenomena: 
        voices and sounds of the dead or past, detected through magnetic audio 
        tape) of a ghost humming a lullaby in </span><span

        be humming a lullaby on </span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:
Helvetica;color:white'> on a day when modern man is playing war?  Knowing the 
        tradition of black and white women during the civil war, the role of a 
        lullaby in black oral tradition, the men that were lost and the women 
        left with the children at home, the sound could have one meaning through 
        a white perspective and a totally different one through a black perspective.  
        To me the decision was to just leave it wide open for interpretation.  
        However, the </span><span

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:
Helvetica;color:white'> radio piece is so much more directed to a point.  That 
        sound was the Secretary of Defense calling out the first draft lottery 
        numbers of World War II.  It was this amazing moment in American radio 
        history.  The whole country was tuned in that night because everyone wanted 
        to hear if their son or husband or brother was going to be called that 
        night.  Hearing it today, with what’s going on, has so much more impact 
        than leaving that up to the imagination.  So that piece called for a different 
        strategy.  It could be so many different criteria that make me decide, 
        but to date, the majority of my pieces have been leaving it up to the 
        imagination of the viewer.</span></p>

        that one lullaby because of the variety of interpretations.  That I could 
        pluck it out of that ether and put it here today and let us meditate on 
        it now is one of the beauties of sampling to me. One of the most beautiful 
        and radical things about sampling is its’ open door policy to cultural 
        memory. <span class=GramE>That conversations</span> can take place through 
        time. That history doesn’t have to be a dead weight, always written by

line-height:150%;font-family:Helvetica;color:white'>A: It’s been great that in 
        the past year we’ve actually seen some resurgence of that tradition, of 
        the singer-songwriter protesting.  I’ve always been envious of another 
        generation’s relationship to music, where so much could be riding on your 
        musical decisions.  I want my decisions to matter like that.  I want to 
        buy so-and-so’s record because it’s some kind of remark against something.  
        But times change and ideas change, and one of the big criticisms towards 
        this generation is that we’re apolitical, ahistorical, we have no real 
        sense of history, and the danger is that we’re going to be dismissed wholeheartedly 
        one day, if we haven’t been already, as being an active generation that 
        didn’t change anything.  That’s why another huge point about sampling 
        is that it offers a way out of that.  As I’ve remarked in another essay, 
        there’s no such thing as a good DJ who’s historically ignorant.  If you 
        don’t know what the politics were of the moment that produced that sound, 
        and so, politics transforming into certain sounds, then why would you 
        take that sound and put it next to this sound.  If you don’t know the 
        history, you’re just making a jumbled mess.  So sampling actually offers 
        a way out of the criticism of this generation because sampling insists 
        that you know your history. That you actually engage with it. That’s why 
        I’m so compelled to know my history.  </span></p>

line-height:150%;font-family:Helvetica;color:white'>A: I definitely want to contribute 
        to these ideas of healing, sampling, and people reinvestigating its political 
        and critical possibilities.  Sampling allows us to go back in time.  I’m 
        mesmerized by these recordings, like Natalie Cole singing a duet with 
        her dead father or the remaining Beatles filling in the blanks of John’s 
        voice since he’s long gone.  Sampling allows these weird things to happen, 
        that are real and that count now.  They are real new creations, but the 
        past is loaded in them.  The technology is so accurate that it sounds 
        like Nat King Cole, Natalie’s father, is singing in the same room with 
        her and a contemporary listener who doesn’t know that history would not 
        know otherwise, so it’s real in a sense.  The healing thing is where I 
        merge this knowledge of history.  Like when I pluck those bullets through 
        time, they’re such a precious object that I better know what I’m talking 
        about or else it’s a huge disrespect, in my opinion, to its history.  
        But in 2004, with what we know now and with the benefit of the hindsight 
        of history, can I pluck something up to this moment and contribute to 
        its healing today?  I want to heal back through time and this is still 
        the metaphor I’m trying to push out.  Can I heal through time?  Does art 
        have the power to fix something that never got fixed, to correct a wrong 
        that’s never been resolved?  “What can art do anymore?” is what I ponder 
        everyday.  What can it really do?  So as artists, what if you walk into 
        your studio everyday and say “today I’m going to make something that works,” 
        what if you just make that little shift in your head when you walk in 
        the studio.  These are the problems that I’m setting up right now.  </span></p>

      <p align="left" class=MsoBodyText3>A: To be hopeful is always a forward 
        looking activity. I just truly believe that by looking to the past we 
        can get to the future on better terms. I’m glad you get it because the 
        work I showed yesterday definitely had dark undertones, but that was only 
        one fragment of my work.  Hope is everywhere in my belief and I hope that 
        comes through because I’m not a pessimistic person.  I want to stress 
        the point that my work is ultimately about hope.  It’s about acknowledging 
        the horror of the past and the present but suggesting that we’re not powerless 
        against it.  We can be proactive about changing things, and that’s where 
        the hope comes in.  The fact that you would even think that you could 
        change something is a hopeful act.  </p>
