  <h3> <span class="jane" style='color:#FF99CC' lang=EN>(Sweet Jane Blows Her 
    Fags) Looking the Other Way<br>
    by Julian E. Stanton <br>
    </span></h3>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC">She deeply inhaled her cigarette, but without 
    any form of elegance – no slow, soothing inhalations nor sharp jawline traced 
    with delicate fingers. Frankly, she smoked in total decadence, defying the 
    one of the primary reasons to smoke in the first place, he thought to himself. 
    To make someone seem to operate with greater finesse than without. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    She, on the other hand, gripped her cigarette like a joint; a precious joint 
    made with the remains of last week’s purchase. It was embarrassing for him 
    to watch, almost as though he were witnessing some lewd act but couldn’t turn 
    away. Not with those hard eyes of hers. Her eyes gripped him like the hold 
    on her cigarette. Why couldn’t she blow that fag the way Grace Kelly did? 
    he asked himself. But the answer was quite simple: this woman before him was 
    no Grace Kelly. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    His eyes followed the seductive trail of smoke at the end, how it mixed with 
    the formless disaster trailing from her mouth and spreading like a plague 
    through the rest of the room. Her lips defiantly curled out as they reached 
    for that cigarette giving a demonic smile or a deformed pout. He couldn’t 
    discern the difference. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    Eventually she noticed him. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><span lang=EN style='color:#FF99CC'><br>
    <img width=574 height=72
src="sweetjane_files/image002.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"></span><br>
    At first, his gaze made her feel naked, but eventually this initial reaction 
    precipitated to unbridled (and coincidentally, unfounded) hatred towards him, 
    before dissipating to vague apathy or melancholy. It was difficult to tell 
    the difference anymore.</font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    Even though she could breathe hard while having sex, it was the cigarette 
    that taught her how to really breathe – to suck in that air as though it were 
    her final breath and exhaling like it would rid her of the toxins in her lungs 
    that she had so diligently procured. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><span lang=EN><br>
    <img width=399 height=72
src="sweetjane_files/image004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"></span><br>
    <br>
    The smoke billowed in her lungs like the faded ocean wave drawn violently 
    back to the sea. She remembered her eight-year-old self unsuccessfully chasing 
    a toy that she dropped at the shore. The ocean stole it from her before she 
    could retrieve it; she remembered seeing it float off in the distance. How 
    she hated the ocean’s muted laughter. And with that thought, she deeply exhaled. 
    The wave crashed against the shore once again. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    She glanced over at him again, sitting so pathetically on that couch with 
    that foolish gaze. Did she want to kiss him or slap him? She knew that she 
    loved him but wasn’t quite sure if she liked him. She would give until the 
    rest of the cigarette to decide. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    Sometimes she liked to see how much ash could accumulate on the cigarette 
    before gravity got the best of her. Sensibility usually won out and she would 
    haphazardly extend her arm – and at times she might extend the effort to use 
    her torso – to that pithy little tin on the coffee table before her. She was 
    weary of ashes on the lap. The ashes were stupidly metaphorical to her, the 
    cliched acknowledgment of life passing her by and left in a tray to be disposed 
    in the rubbish bin. She clung to that analogy, though, because it made the 
    ignition of the next cigarette more rewarding. Her personal catharsis for 
    $3.99 a pack or whatever they were going for those days. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><span lang=EN style='color:#FF99CC'><br>
    <img width=574 height=72
src="sweetjane_files/image002.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"></span><br>
    He desperately wanted teach her how to properly smoke a cigarette, but feared 
    that he would seem too patronizing. He hated following her demented social 
    code yet loved her too much to deny it. If she asked, he gladly would have 
    been her ashtray. She could use his palm, his forearm, his face. It didn’t 
    matter. What he really wished he could be was her cigarette – that she would 
    evade as many social situations and obligations to be with him as she does 
    for her precious fag: when she wakes up, waits for her bus, takes breaks from 
    her work. Always. That she would save her breath as she did with her smoke 
    and how she smoked it like it was her last breath. Then cling to him like 
    he was her only lover, the way she did with that goddamn object. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    Not that he really knew how to smoke cigarettes anyway. He simply knew how 
    ought not to smoke them. He sighed. Sometimes it hurt him how much he loved 
    her. And her cold, blank stare froze him until his body cracked. All he could 
    do was turn away and forget. Mesmerize himself with the trail of smoke silhouetted 
    by the penetrating sunlight. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><span lang=EN><br>
    <img width=399 height=72
src="sweetjane_files/image004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"></span><br>
    <br>
    Her cigarette was at its withering end. She reluctantly snubbed it out and 
    sorrowfully watched its final embers linger. Pretending to rub her nose, she 
    casually – though tactically – raised her left hand. But who was she kidding? 
    She wanted one final whiff of that repulsive scent. Like the lingering smell 
    on a pillow of a lost lover. Then she remembered that her lover was sitting 
    seven feet away, defeated. Was it I who defeated him? she wondered to herself. 
    There was a time when she would have taken a great pleasure in such an accomplishment. 
    To call this an accomplishment, though, would be calling a shit after lunch 
    an accomplishment as well. Thoughtless, inevitable, and predictable in its 
    methodology and outcome. Because taking a shit really requires a method. Crushing 
    his ego was even easier. </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><br>
    No, he had it all wrong. She did look at him like her cigarettes, especially 
    the one lying in the tray. With a pang of regret and soft nostalgia. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p class="jane"><font color="FF99CC"><img width=574 height=72
src="sweetjane_files/image002.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"><br>
    What more can be said? She lit another to avoid the questions that continued 
    to haunt her. Or maybe to start another one of her silly metaphorical existences. 
    And he looked out the window, trying to capture the seemingly recent memory 
    of what it is like to be loved. The smoke trailed out and was swallowed by 
    the wind. </font><br>
