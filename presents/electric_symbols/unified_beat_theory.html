        incorrigible Pretension, attempts to explain the entire universe (well, 
        in all technicality, the social and political aspects thereof), in the

        he is probably imitating something that he read over a couple of beers 
        and a cigarette while “Three’s Company” played out its heartfelt drama 
        on the television. But then again, they say that T.S. Eliot worked on 
        “the Wasteland” while on the set of his hit-network sitcom “Here’s the

      <p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>I.</b></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Rhythm and You!</b></p>
      <p align="left">            The natural world can be conceived in many ways 
        as an enormous number of different cycles running in tandem with each 
        other, clicking together like the gears in a machine, with the rotation 
        of some components giving rise to others which eventually cycle back to 
        their original state. The seasons are a clichéd example but an effective 
        one.</p>
      <p align="left">            Human beings, as part of this system, are also 
        similarly affected by the general structure of this mechanical structure. 
        As the cog moves in the machine, spring comes <i>–click</i>—and hormones 
        rush into the mind as human mating season begins. Winter arrives and <i>–click</i>- 
        the action of the machine slows down metabolism, and so on.</p>
      <p align="left">            Assuming some kind of cosmic recording system, 
        listening to the years at high speed, a definite, rhythmic structure would 
        be detected in this simple relationship between hormone production and 
        natural seasonal rhythms. An even click echoing out a percussive beat 
        would arise.</p>
      <p align="center"> <img
width=317 height=93

v:shapes="_x0000_s1026">            </p>
      <p align="left">C ertainly this is an idealization, and the rhythms are 
        somewhat more complex, looking, perhaps, something like this: </p>
      <p align="left">Which, admittedly, is Chopin’s<i> Lento ma non troppo,  in 
        E Major, </i>but without anything better, this one will have to suffice 
        for our purposes. Don’t you agree?</p>
      <p align="left">But this game goes further as well, human beings also operate 
        underneath the auspices of a modern technological society, one that, perhaps 
        most tellingly, is beginning to operate in a very fundamental way on as 
        a series of quantized switches, turning on and off in the dry, air conditioned 
        darkness of a computer server room somewhere. </p>
      <p align="left"><span>            </span>Again, the human condition becomes 
        one of rhythm, schedule, and control. We move in correspondence with in 
        the context of continually larger and larger edifices which again create 
        a rhythm in everything from movement to conversation. Is it any surprise 
        to ourselves when it is asserted that the inherent iambic consequence 
        of the English language lends itself to a pacing of everyday language?<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>

      <p align="left"><span>            </span>Even the very way in which a building 
        is constructed, where the bathrooms are placed, where rooms are places, 
        how secure the locks are governs the very fabric and nature of social 
        interaction. One might be particularly inclined to note how the set up 
        of dormitories suggest themselves to particular kinds of interaction and 
        analysis.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

      <p align=left style='text-align:center'><b>The Eventuality of Wave Intersection</b></p>
      <p align="left"><span>            </span>Observe though, since society itself 
        has a direct rhythm to it. (And therefore the aggregate forces of civilization 
        itself as governed by these huge, larger cycles which are comprised of 
        the microscopic components that make them up, but are at once greater 
        than all of them combined. In short, that the whole is greater than the 
        sum of its parts.) Then we would naturally expect for wave interference 
        to occur as two different forces came into contact with each other.</p>
      <p align="left"><span>            </span>Consider the example of the ill 
        produced series of urinals. One notes that in a series of three urinals 
        places next to each other, the middle one is the cleanest, since the societal 
        enforcement of the mechanical beat of flushing states quite energetically 
        that two males will never stand directly adjacent to one another during 
        urination. This is one rhythmic cycle Another one is present, since beverages 
        are served and consumed at approximately the same times each day, there 
        is a certain curve which would describe the rate of usages per unit time. 
        We can draw a table of this regularity.</p>

      <p align="left"><span>            </span>In essence, what is occurring here 
        is that that middle urinal represents a beat rest in the rhythmic cycle 
        that we see developing on average (of course the table is an idealized 
        model, but the fact is that there should be a repeated pattern over the 
        course of a period of time which describes the activity on average that 
        is indeed a pattern). Thus, assuming that each urinal is a “space” for 
        a quarter note, bars of music begin to emerge.</p>
      <p align="left"><span>            </span> This, in effect is wave interference, 
        which is shown visually and quite compellingly below. (Do you believe 
        me now? How about now? Now?)</p>

v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"> </p>
      <p align="left"><span>            </span>The biological cycle is interfering 
        with the sociological cycle to give rise to a structural, measurable behavior. 
         The high points in these waves are the discernable beats that we do notice. 
        The aggregate behavior of the whole system if you will, as in the fact 
        that we notice that the middle urinal is clean.</p>
      <p align="left"><span>            </span>But now think about this on an 
        even larger scale, if all the universe is an intersecting series of cycles, 
        then as long as the timing is right, you, yes YOU, have the apparent ability 
        to slip through the intersecting gears and locks created by the natural 
        world. In essence, the very theory of beats suggests that there are times 
        in which beats <i>don’t </i>occur. And therefore, I could be standing 
        right in front of you and you might never notice, since the cycles are 
        correct and in order.</p>
      <p align="left"><span>            </span>Perhaps that explains coincidence, 
        “mojo,” prescience, superpowers and unexplained ghosts in the night. Perhaps 
        their just old grooves and cycles rotating together at the right way in 
        the right time to create an extending constructively interfering wave. 
        Now…just to figure out how to use it… </p>
