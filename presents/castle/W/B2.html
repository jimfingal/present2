        they cloned the first stone, says the radio: it is fine for skipping over 
        still water, small, round, as if contracting its surface, as if keeping 
        something back. It has seemed impenetrable, said Dr. Lars Schneider, for 
        years and years we worked on this rock and often it seemed we would never 
        get inside, never harvest its plans and directions for its assembly. Tonight 
        the lab is empty while everyone celebrates at the bar across the street. 
        But there's still work, they say, tracing the ancestry of rocks, broken 
        from mother stones and sea-tossed old.</font></p>

        - johannadrucker. she does theory.<br>
        - lee scott macdonald. he makes papermaking equipment.<br>
        - the mobilivre people.<br>
        - one of the '13+' european artistsbookartists. check out livresdesartistes.com. 
        especially unica t, this now defunct collective of four women: &quot;unica 
        t is a fictious person making real books.&quot; now these women are working 
        on usus (boatbook.de) and the tloen encyclopedia (tloen-enzyklopaedie.de)<br>
        - but why am i so stuck on books? have to think sounds. okay, how about:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">these theoretical 
        rooms that acousticians dream up. my roommate is interested in them. i 
        would say that he could just write the article, but he is busy and also 
        german. not that his english is bad, but, you know, it's harder for him.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">i could write 
        something about how german sounds, i guess, but i don't actually have 
        any science or linguistics background so that might be a little silly. 
        more than that i want to interview whoever is responsible for this bizarre 
        enchanted &quot;art supply&quot; store around the corner that sells supplies 
        for the future and as of yet unimagined things, as far as i can tell, 
        like a hardware store and industrial supply store for machines and processes 
        that do not yet exist. they seem to specialize in things in sheets and 
        rolls. like every variation on plastic ever.</font></p>

        of a friend of a friend, and has done work at ART, but more to the point 
        i think he's really cool. full circle, the play he did at ART, a revision 
        of berlin circle, is genius, and says things about germany and its history 
        and charcater and art and literature that the germans themselves can't 
        say with such tersity, if that's even a word.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">blah. ich bin

      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        <br>
        okay here is the begining of something maybe</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">on boxhagenerplatz 
        on sunday there is this flea market, except it is not just a flea market 
        and if you have spent any time fantasizing about berlin in the 21st century, 
        well, yes, that is where it is.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but this is not 
        the point.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">last sunday, 
        there was this big crowd of people, and in the middle was this hippie 
        boy sitting on a speaker. and remember once upon a time &quot;two turntables 
        and a microphone&quot;? well it was like that but no turntables, just 
        a microphone oh and a machine that will loop things, i forget the name 
        although he said it many times. it might be called &quot;loop station&quot; 
        or &quot;loop mixer&quot; or &quot;tesla coil&quot; or keinefuckingahnung. 
        and anyhow he made many strange noises with his body, and sometimes did 
        more traditional sound making things like singing, playing the guitar, 
        blowing over the water bottle we thought he was going to drink from. but 
        the point is he would start with one sound, and improvise, until after 
        five minutes there are a dozen sounds playing together and the everybody 
        is hanging on gasping wondering what will he do next. also because it 
        is berlin all crowds also feature: dogs, very little kids, very big kids 
        dancing and rolling cigarettes. but most people are just kind of breathless.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">sometimes over 
        the music he freestyles. i find this impressive because i am impressed 
        the command of the german language exhibited by any and all native speakers. 
        i wonder if i should be impressed, though, because occasionally he plays 
        actual songs that he has written, with german and english lyrics which 
        are frankly sappy. this is from someone who cherishes earnestness.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but i think what 
        i am most interested in is this: the crowd thinks it is magic. they are 
        awed, no matter that they know the trick. they were just as captivated 
        when feist did it, singing into the microphone until it sang back. and 
        she was just a little canadian girl; the guy on boxhagenerplatz is a sorcerer, 
        and maybe it's an act or maybe it's drugs, but his entire body is keeping 
        the beat and he loses his shirt and shoes as he writhes around, in a world 
        not really ours. but the crowd, even after he shows us exactly how the 
        magic boy operates, is also entranced.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">i thought i would 
        go back tomorrow to see him again, but all of a sudden i am meeting agnieszka 
        at ostbahnhof at 1, so i don't know. but also i don't know how this could 
        be an article. i don't have recording devices. i don't even have a camera. 
        ideas? help?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">here is something 
        i started thinking about watching kings of convenience and feist and kept 
        thinking about watching this hippie boy: some musicians are performing 
        for themselves, or for their songs or for Art, or to pay the bills, or 
        whatever. and some people are there for their audience, are performing 
        because they want to assemble that crowd and give something to them, and 
        as long as they can hold them there, that's their job. it reminds me of 
        present in this way: maybe the idea is just to have something to give 
        our friends, and also maybe strangers.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">oh kids i like 
        it here but i miss you. vote44, whoever they are, has giant signs all 
        over this city that say &quot;a new president for america,&quot; and something 
        about that third person voice makes me feel very far away. but, yeah, 
        a new president for america, and enjoy your peanut butter extra for me.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">deine abigail</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">ere's more i 
        guess.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">oh but first: 
        the present and pirate websites have both impressed me muchly. i would 
        like to add this: i have recently learned that when a girl is decked out 
        (is that what we would say in english??? tarted up? with makeup and such, 
        i mean), in german youth slang speak, you can call say that she is ausgetackelt. 
        but ausgetackelt actually refers to a ship under full sail and rigging. 
        ah pirate etymology. ah i actually do miss the sea.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but i want a 
        new email address! although i could not tell you why, it is clearly unnecessary. 
        but it wouldn&#8217;t have to fit in my suitcase.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but you get my 
        story because no one else will have it. also i have another idea: the 
        significant other of one of my mom&#8217;s old housemates is now an english 
        professor at tufts, and her speciality is the Beats, specifically female 
        Beats. There is an anthology (of academic papers) that she co-edited called 
        Girls Who Wore Black: Women Writing the Beat Generation. the title comes 
        from kerouac&#8217;s semi-famous definition of a hipster, &#8220;whose 
        girls say nothing and wear black,&#8221; and anyway it&#8217;s pretty 
        good. maybe we could come up with some punchy questions to ask? i say 
        we meaning some sort of nondescript collective we who know and care more 
        about the Beats than i, maybe there is no such we and so this idea ends 
        and my beet story-in-search-of-a-plot begins:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">this part actually 
        happened in munich: &#8220;sie sind rote bete,&#8221; he says, offering 
        me the plate of beets. this means: they are beets. there&#8217;s also 
        a small amount of chopped onion and parsely. he smiles, speaks slowly, 
        expectantly, as if offering absinthe to an alien. &#8220;kennst du rote 
        bete?&#8221; i smile and nod, explain, yes, we eat beets in the states 
        too. also, last week, i say, i tried beet juice.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">back in berlin: 
        someone had made it and brought it to brunch. this person had made other 
        juices too, but &#8220;rote bete,&#8221; he said earnestly, &#8220;ist 
        gesund.&#8221; healthy. it tasted like that too, meaning it tasted like 
        root vegetables and dirt and your parents who moved to the country in 
        the 70s.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">everyone there 
        eating brunch was born in the following years, and are now enjoying their 
        twenties in the city. if we were home with our parents in the country 
        listening to their old beatles records, they might have asked: how does 
        it feel to be one of the beautiful people?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but we know that 
        we aren&#8217;t. we missed the nineties, we have only vague images of 
        people talking about a third way that is neither communism or capitalism 
        and dancing in the streets and warehouses and courtyards and train stations. 
        and now we don&#8217;t know, we don&#8217;t know about revolution, but 
        we are fairly sure that we&#8217;ll never make it through school, or at 
        least that when we do, there won&#8217;t be a job waiting. we are trying 
        not to think how many years this juice will taste so fresh, the colors- 
        the vermilion juice, the golden sunlight- so bright.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">for the most 
        part, the fading&#8217;s already begun. the not-so-alternative alternative 
        weeklies know it too: &#8220;F&uuml;r die Macher von nicht konzessioniert 
        Bars und Clubs werden die Zeiten harter,&#8221; [for the sponsors of unliscened 
        bars and clubs, the times are getting harder] reads the headline in zitty: 
        a slew of former berlin scenesters describe the gradual loss of the city 
        as &#8220;ein anarchisticher Abenteurspielplatz,&#8221; (an anarchistic 
        adventure-playground, and you have to see the real Abenteurspielplaetze 
        - they six year olds you build, like. actual structures and fires and 
        stuff, and i&#8217;m jealous) as its vacant squat-spaces are filled and 
        its aesthetic commodified . but how do the beets taste now? my friend 
        claudia, born and raised in (east) berlin, on the topic of local produce: 
        &#8220;say what you like about the GDR, but at least then we knew where 
        our vegetables were coming from!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">when you are 
        making the beat, you can imagine magical metamorphoses, twists of rhythm 
        becoming heart palpitations in distant balkan villages where 4-4 time 
        sounds neanderthal. not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with neanderthals. 
        but the point is, maybe you can dream futures, write manifestos, maybe 
        you can even carry them out.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but we are the 
        kids who just got here, we are dancing awkwardly, we feel the beat but 
        we aren&#8217;t sure where it&#8217;s going. maybe if we knew we wouldn&#8217;t 
        dance so earnestly, with all our energy and joy and heart. for the record, 
        if this were a metaphor i too would find it corny and absurd and forced, 
        but this is actually how kids in berlin dance: without self-conscious 
        style or pretty makeup, trying out bits of walzer or belly dance or whatever 
        they&#8217;ve just learned. but in any case, the only beat we know is 
        the present one, and since we are young and probably drunk, this is just 
        fine.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">except that there 
        is also something unsettling about not knowing. especially here, where 
        the twentieth century weighs heavy, and manic. you want to ask him, if 
        i am else lasker-schuler, will you be my gottfried benn? except then you 
        would have to flee to switzerland and palestine, and besides, he&#8217;s 
        too pretty for you.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">maybe this is 
        why everyone asks me anxiously about american politics, about the patriot 
        act, and who will i vote for, also am i scared of terrorism, what do i 
        think of george bush, noam chomsky. they are looking for the next catastrophe, 
        refusing to be totally surprised.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">and in the meantime: 
        dancing, painting, reading; living on beer, cigarettes, milchkaffee, and 
        root vegetables.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">i have more to 
        say about the older avant gardes but it might be kind of academic and 
        i have already rambled so long and obnoxious and insufferable. and poor 
        you! don&#8217;t be a martyr, honey, go outside and play and tell the 
        other kids i miss them.</font></p>
