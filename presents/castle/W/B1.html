        &#8220;Lamont Library: Students After Hours&#8221; </font></strong></em></div>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I entered the 
        library at around 11.45 PM, after some trouble with my ID. I was wearing 
        sunglasses. I descended the stairs toward Gov Docs and encountered the 
        other people at the door to Gov Docs. Our expectation that no one would 
        find us there was verified when we ascended to find darkness. I climbed 
        to the 5th floor with the others and unpacked my things: a computer and 
        my books. In the solace and comfort of the library late at night, I had 
        hoped to get some work done. I didn&#8217;t do work. I retrieved a book 
        from the poetry room, I returned to a circle and shared poetry. I read 
        America and I read &#8220;Cambridge&#8221; by Frank O&#8217;Hara. In that 
        poem ol&#8217; Frank, sitting next to his window feeling the doldrums 
        of winter and the sublime pressure to write in the wake of other poets, 
        talks about a lonely building he sees across the street through the rain. 
        &#8220;I will go there,&#8221; he says.<br>
        <br>
        The incident at Lamont library was unfortunate. It is true that we knew 
        it was against the rules. This was likely part of the attraction of trying 
        to sleepover. But it wasn&#8217;t the explicit impetus at all, nor was 
        that ever discussed. (I won&#8217;t get into a meditation on the rules 
        which Rousseau and Foucault and others have already done). If we thought 
        our actions would be hurting anyone, or anything, we would absolutely 
        not have done it. Perhaps &#8220;actions&#8221; here is an inappropriate 
        word; it misses part of the reasons for this, which is to say, few reasons, 
        and none of them having to do necessarily with &#8220;action&#8221;, at 
        least to the extent that &#8220;action&#8221; connotes force or usefulness 
        or implies reaction. We did willfully try to evade those closing the library, 
        and by chance we succeeded. But beyond that we did nothing but sit around 
        on the 5th floor of Lamont library and talk, read to each other, share 
        things, stories. We made dances. This was not intended as a political 
        statement, though it can be taken that way&#8212;of course, we had no 
        intention of broadcasting this incident because we gave it no purpose 
        outside of ourselves. And that to us was an important purpose. <br>
        <br>
        With a fair dose of levity, we seriously considered the staying-in-the-library 
        as an alteration to the standards of our everyday life at Harvard, that 
        which is often defined by hermetic learning spaces; we sought to transform 
        or invert such a space, and by extension, the mindsets attendant with 
        that space, into a place of no time and no place, where for a time we 
        could both learn and exist together. Our first rule was to find books 
        that we wanted to read to each other and do so. We did. We shared poems 
        (Amichai, Ginsberg, Wright) and we learned things (about the construction 
        of underwater tunnels, about the argonauts, C.S. Lewis, aboriginal sexual 
        practices of the tropics). Some people took notes. Later we shared stories. 
        (Clarification: We were not using fire. We did not have a video camera.) 
        We wanted to exist together without restraints, as anyone does; that we 
        chose the library at Harvard as a sort of &#8220;rebellion&#8221; or freeing 
        I think shows that our interest was modest and harmless, and that our 
        freeing was meant to be both completely useless (to anyone but ourselves) 
        but also productive and constructive of a new mode of being at Harvard.<br>
        <br>
        I understand that none of my explanations may matter, and may seem ludicrous, 
        or silly, or uninteresting in the context of safety concerns, security 
        concerns and the like. But I hope it does, if not to the process, at least 
        to the people reading this. <br>
        <br>
        I am somewhat ashamed to be in this position. Despite my behavior in this 
        incident, my appreciation for the library system&#8217;s buildings, its 
        staff and its books is evidenced by the thousands of times my ID number 
        has floated through the computer system, and the monumental towers of 
        books scattered around my room, intimidating and inspiring me. <br>
        <br>
        Our intent was benign and my, and our, last-minute decision to do this, 
        took into account things that have always been important to me, and I 
        trust the rest of my friends, when my behavior is in some way questionable: 
        whether my action would hurt others, whether I would damage others&#8217; 
        property, whether I would be irresponsible. <br>
        <br>
        While the decision to do this was somewhat spontaneous, it was not exactly 
        rash, made in the heat of the moment, in the way that one makes a decision 
        to throw a punch. (Also: I should say that my capacity for careful, analytical 
        problem solving is not fantastic, as evidenced by my EC10 grade and my 
        math SAT score, which you no doubt have already examined.) I like to think 
        of myself as a considerate, respectful and fair person, and I&#8217;d 
        like to think that those qualities informed my quick decision to stay 
        in the library after hours.<br>
        <br>
        To some extent they did, but to other extents, they did not. They most 
        certainly did not. <br>
        <br>
        We love the library and we wanted to have it to ourselves. Love was there, 
        but selfishness too. <br>
        <br>
        Mostly though<br>
