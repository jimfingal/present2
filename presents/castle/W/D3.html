    type</strong><br>
    <strong>by Abigail Miller</strong><br>
    </font> 
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">so I was distributing 
      type listening to an old mix and the noise in the pipes and -- <br>
      <br>
      distributing type: in letterpress printing, after you have printed and cleaned, 
      the last thing to do is to distribute: to take your text letter by letter 
      and put each tiny lead letter back in its place in the case of type.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">is that closure? 
      is closure what shuts out the reader? what reader? wasn&#8217;t this my 
      secret language? or was it more like a letter?</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but, then, alone, 
      it seemed to me that this half-distributed pile of little lead letters was 
      the form this poem had always sought I would pick up pieces of lines and 
      amidst the backwards letters I could not help recognizing words. picking 
      up meaning, startling myself with words which seem sacred for having survived 
      by chance, with the whole worlds that clutched at fragments. the world of 
      the poem, but mostly my associations with where it came from.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">-- and every so 
      often the noises in the pipes sounded like another person coming into the 
      press, and this always shook me.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Where the poem 
      came from: in the miseries and confusion of freshman year, in the spring, 
      in a copy of DoubleTake in the Fine Arts Library, I chanced across a poem 
      by James Galvin, called &#8216;Leap Year&#8217;. I photocopied it and tucked 
      it into an envelope in my notebook. It contained the line &#8216;Oh Persephone, 
      home&#8217;s not where I / thought it was.&#8221; I started writing poems 
      to Persephone. Here&#8217;s the last one, from about a year later, in Helsinki: 
      </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">persephone, did 
      you even wake up<br>
      maybe too early in the morning<br>
      and not know the season, under from<br>
      over, or maybe find yourself in<br>
      a place that is always cold and light<br>
      where the sky loses its blue, looks<br>
      like paper, and did you want <br>
      to write across it,<br>
      hades, I miss you?</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">persephone, does 
      it occur to you<br>
      that I am talking to myself here?<br>
      i&#8217;ve lost my stars and muses<br>
      in the sun that won&#8217;t set</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">it was even more 
      melodramatic than the preceding persephone poems, and i knew that should 
      be the end. I began writing real letters to real people.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">but when i returned 
      to the states the following fall i thought maybe the last thing i would 
      do for persephone was to print a book, called &#8220;song for persephone,&#8221; 
      and a palinode. it would be small and modest, with little words on each 
      little page, and it would look old, look like it was disintegrating, or 
      had already. it would be hard to read but maybe there would be someone who 
      would turn each little page and try to piece it together. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">it wanted to be 
      small and modest but it took a fucking long time to make. mock-ups, typesetting, 
      printing, proofing, printing some more, assembling, binding. and just when 
      it seemed long over, after critiques and openings and daily dramas, then 
      there was distributing. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I don&#8217;t know 
      which is harder, begining a project or ending. You distribute type, and 
      there are these words, their different associations and lengths and weights 
      in your hand. But you take them apart, and there&#8217;s just the simplest 
      heartbeat tempo of single letters: e, h, t, space. I stood there, in between 
      my poem (my freshman year, my neuroses and myths) and the world of afterwards, 
      the one coming into being as the book was distributed.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Writing this now, 
      I didn&#8217;t remember that line from James Galvin correctly. I found the 
      poem to check it&#8212;it&#8217;s in his book, X&#8212;and I noticed another 
      line, that seems more important now: &#8220;Forgetting about the future 
      makes the moment / you live in slouch. / Excuse me while I digest this small 
      galaxy.&#8221; It makes me think of a sci fi movie, one where the space-time 
      continuum becomes visible, glows &amp; undulates. We gaze out at together 
      through the window of our spaceship, knowing that we are here &amp; now, 
      a small place, everything else bearing down around us.</font></p>
